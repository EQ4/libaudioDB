INSTALLATION
============

The basic procedure is:

make
make test
make install

libaudioDB Dependencies
-----------------------

bash: audioDB's test suite depends on /bin/sh being bash, version 3.0
      or greater.

gsl: the GNU Scientific Library.

Compiling
---------

Use the following make commands to compile libaudioDB on your system:

Linux:         make

OS X or Win32: make \
  GSL_INCLUDE'"-I /path/to/gsl/"
  LIBGSL="-L/path/to/libgsl/libraries -lgsl -lgslcblas"

(where the path to GSL_INCLUDE should name the directory which
gsl_rng.h resides.)

Testing
-------

libaudioDB comes with a suite of test scripts that verify that
particular pieces of functionality are behaving acceptably.  They
depend on /bin/sh being GNU bash, version 3 or greater.  The test
suite can be run with the command "make test".

When running on systems without sparse file support (notably those
using the default filesystem in Mac OS X), running the test suite
requires approximately 70GB of free hard disk space.  On other
systems, disk usage from running the test suite is negligible.

Installation
------------

By default, the library and header file will be installed under the
prefix /usr/local. Edit the Makefile PREFIX value to select a
different installation location.

To install, issue the command:

make install

You will need sufficient privileges to write to your chosen
installation location and to execute the ldconfig command.
